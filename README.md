# qrproject

Hello, everybody! <br>
this is a simple project, but my first full-stack project!

<div style="display: flex;">
    <img src="frontend/imgs/screenshotFront.png" style = "width: 490px; ">
    <img src="frontend/imgs/sreenShotMobile.png" style = "width: 25%;">
</div>
<br>
I developed the front-end using: HTML, CSS, BootStrap e JavaScript.
And Backend was made with Node.js, and `qrcode` Library from npm.

<h2>Why i did this project?</h2>
I wanted to get experience with a back-end development, so I developer this project. <br>
I want more experience in this area, if you have some suggestion, text me on Whatsapp.
<br> <br>

My next step is to learn how I can apply this to web services.
